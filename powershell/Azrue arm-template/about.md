The provided script is an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template written in JSON format. Here's what it handles:

1. **Parameters:**
   - `vmName`: Specifies the name of the virtual machine.
   - `location`: Specifies the location where the virtual machine is deployed.
   - `fileUris`: Specifies the URIs of the files to be downloaded and executed on the virtual machine.
   - `arguments`: Specifies the arguments to be passed to the script.

2. **Variables:**
   - `UriFileNamePieces`: Splits the `fileUris` parameter into pieces based on '/'.
   - `firstFileNameString`: Extracts the last piece of the URI, which represents the filename along with any query parameters.
   - `firstFileNameBreakString`: Splits the `firstFileNameString` variable into filename and query parameters.
   - `firstFileName`: Extracts the filename from the `firstFileNameBreakString`.

3. **Resources:**
   - It defines a custom script extension resource named `CustomScriptExtension` for the specified virtual machine.
   - The extension is associated with the virtual machine specified by `vmName`.
   - The extension is deployed in the specified `location`.
   - It uses the `Microsoft.Compute` publisher and `CustomScriptExtension` type.
   - The `typeHandlerVersion` is set to `"1.9"`.
   - The extension's settings include the command to execute the script (`commandToExecute`) and the URIs of the files to download (`fileUris`).
   - The `commandToExecute` executes a PowerShell script with unrestricted execution policy, passing the filename and arguments provided in the parameters.

This ARM template automates the deployment of a custom script extension to an Azure virtual machine, allowing users to execute scripts on the VM after deployment.
