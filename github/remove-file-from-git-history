Title: Removing a File from Git History and Verifying Its Deletion Using `git filter-branch`

Steps to Remove the File and Update the Remote Repository

1. **Rewrite Git History to Remove the File**
   Use the following command to remove the specific file from the repository history:
   ```bash
   git filter-branch --force --index-filter "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.80.0/windows_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.80.0_x5.exe" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
   ```

2. **Clean Up After History Rewrite**
   Run the following commands to clean up Git's metadata and optimize the repository:
   ```bash
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

3. **Force Push the Updated History to the Remote Repository**
   After rewriting the history locally, force-push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

#### Verifying the File's Removal

1. **Check if the File Exists in Git History**
   To verify if the file has been removed from the repository history, run:
   ```bash
   git log --all -- .terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/5.80.0/windows_amd64/terraform-provider-aws_v5.80.0_x5.exe
   ```
   If the file has been successfully removed, this command will not return any commits.

2. **List Files in the Repository and Search for the File**
   Use the following command to confirm that the file no longer exists in the current branch:
   - On Unix-based systems:
     ```bash
     git ls-tree -r main --name-only | grep terraform-provider-aws_v5.80.0_x5.exe
     ```
   - On Windows PowerShell (since `grep` is unavailable, use `Select-String`):
     ```powershell
     git ls-tree -r main --name-only | Select-String terraform-provider-aws_v5.80.0_x5.exe
     ```

#### Notes
- The `git filter-branch` command is a powerful but risky tool that can rewrite commit history. Use it with caution.
- For safer alternatives, consider using [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) as suggested in the warning.
- Always take a backup of your repository before running history-altering commands.
