# **Project Overview**
**Components**


1- S3 Bucket:
----------
A sacred repository holding the texts awaiting translation. Upload your text files here, and let the magic unfold.

2- Lambda Functions:
--------------------
The enchanters of our project, Lambda functions, act as intermediaries between the S3 bucket and AWS Translate. They respond to events, invoking the translation spells upon the arrival of new texts.

3- AWS Translate:
---------------------
The sorcerer's apprentice, AWS Translate, performs the actual translation. With a vast knowledge of languages, it transforms your texts from one linguistic realm to another.

4- IAM Permissions:
-------------------------
The guardian of our magical realm, IAM (Identity and Access Management), grants the necessary permissions to ensure a smooth and secure translation experience. With the right permissions, users can unlock the full potential of the translation spells.
