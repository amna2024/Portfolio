The document provides a PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) script to install a module named "xcomputermanagement" and configure the computer name. Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. **Install Module**: 
   - Command: `Install-Module xcomputermanagement`
   - Purpose: Installs the "xcomputermanagement" module, which is required for managing computer settings using DSC.

2. **Configuration Block "computername"**:
   - Begins the DSC configuration block named "computername" which defines the desired state of the computer.

3. **Import-DscResource**:
   - Commands:
     ```
     Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
     Import-DscResource -ModuleName xcomputermanagement
     ```
   - Purpose: Imports the required DSC resources for the configuration. This includes resources from both the built-in "PSDesiredStateConfiguration" module and the "xcomputermanagement" module.

4. **Node Block**:
   - Begins the definition of the target node (in this case, the local machine) where the configuration will be applied.
   - Node Name: `localhost`

5. **xComputer Resource**:
   - Command:
     ```
     xComputer changename
         {
         Name = "dsccilent"
         }
     ```
   - Purpose: Configures the computer name to be changed to "dsccilent" using the "xComputer" DSC resource provided by the "xcomputermanagement" module.

6. **End of Configuration Block**:
   - Marks the end of the configuration block.

7. **Invoke DSC Configuration**:
   - Command:
     ```
     Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\computername -Wait -Verbose
     ```
   - Purpose: Initiates the DSC configuration using the script defined in the "computername" configuration block. The `-Path` parameter specifies the path to the configuration script. The `-Wait` parameter ensures that the command waits until the configuration process completes, and `-Verbose` provides detailed progress information.

8. **Generate DSC Checksum**:
   - Command:
     ```
     New-DscChecksum ".\computername"
     ```
   - Purpose: Generates a checksum file for the configuration script named "computername". This checksum file can be used to validate the integrity of the configuration script during subsequent deployments.

This document and script are intended to automate the process of changing the computer name using PowerShell Desired State Configuration.
